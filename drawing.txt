MICROSERFS By Douglas Coupland. 1 Microserfs. FRIDAY Early Fall, 1993, This morning, just after 11:00, Michael locked himself in h
is office and he wont come out. Bill Bill! sent Michael this totally wicked flame-mail from hell on the e-mail system - and he jus
t wailed on a chunk of code Michael had written Exactly why Bill would choose Michael of all people to wail on is confusing. Bills
 so smart. Bill is wise. Bill is kind. Nerds overfocus. A PC or a Lego brick by itself is inert and pointless: a doorstop; litter.
 We pass the snacks. Monogamous? asks Susan But beyond this theres what Karla said - about being human, and the dream of humanity.
 She looked at the jar. Mom phoned. Dad. She glurped a milkshake. So. the time I had the sunstroke episode. Yeah? Let me put this

Well you know what I mean. S. So alone. I want to be. out there. What. No, look. So looks are moot. But then they see me - my body
 - and its over. Meet BarCode. a job. Odd. Watched CNN. We had to pay. we were just the sort of people you dont want staying in th

gety-fidgety in space. Hellooooo. S. Gag. We worked. Mr. U.    hellojed  . Exactly why Bill would choose Michael of all people to 
wail on is confusing. Bill, Be My Friend. She srprizd me. g. I thought about this. The concept of body as hard drive seemed very p
lausible to me. Michael is hiring people. e. I thought so. When I was young, if I built a house out of Lego, the house had to be a
ll in one color. said Bug. Yes. We were here. C. Karma. We made this rule that we had to honk every time we spotted road kill, and
 we nearly burned out our horns. I was quiet. Its a hive mind. Even Karla. In New York everyones writing a novel. You are gripped.
 Suspension of disbelief is not an issue. Evil. e. No. I think the dynamic of Mom and Karlas relationship has been set. At least t
hey dont hate each other. S. these. ozone. Yeah. My ears were red. The Valley is so career-o-centric. Its science fiction here. It
s next week. That I can do this. Oh, Bug. You never know. He never sleeps. Geek party night: its kind of like if we were in Hollyw

. Sometimes it can be off-putting. Gag gifts. Oohhh. and. I want a backup. And he said, Youre not feeling very well, are you, son.
 And I said, Nnn. no. I was silent. Let me finish. ? G. ii. B. One right-side up - another upside down. Todd and Dusty seem to hav

cedar shingles of his lanai. That kind of stuff. A. A dive. Susan says its a male aesthetic. EAs parking lot was so odd - entirely
 composed of brand-new cars. No matter. S. Yes. it. I cant. So it looks as if Chyx is real. CNN really changed her world. How long
 have I been here? I cant tell Ethan. Coded Oop! She. He. I think the porno awards were a bad influence on them. But the Sony part
y. It was like porn acting. A: False. Wait. I felt so close to her. I said, I guess its sort of futile trying to keep a backup fil

n: tell her. We worked. We coded. Mr. Its like Im reading 1970s cocktail napkins out loud to you. Hes actually more animated than 
he is in conversations with us. U. U. oh look. Woo! Last week there was a jolt Last week Karla said, You have to go further, Dan, 
you have to hold her body. So then she could speak to us. I tried, and couldnt remember. She said it would probably take me a lot 
longer than Id think. The smell. Try and you cant. Hood. I said, Mom, Mom. tell me its you. Tell me something I never liked in my 
lunch bag at school. U. , our massage. U. like encryption. All of my messing around with words last year and now, well. its real l

 really degrading for him. FRIDAY one week later  Dad quit his job. He showed up at the office around two in the afternoon to tell
 me. Underhill. Mom was P-I-S-S-E-D off. But that, I said, is exactly what Ethan believes. Silence. Ethan shot me a self-satisfied
 glance, and the ex-Gang of Two went to work without much ado. Really, said Michael, I hope this here is the end of politics. Whic
