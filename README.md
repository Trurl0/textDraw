# textDraw
Create a drawing using the natural ocurring spaces on a text by picking phrases out of a book.

Using a model and a text picks phrases from the text and writes them in a new file, verifying that non-space characters in the model are left as spaces in the new text, thus creating an instance of the model drawn using the spaces of the new text.
Pretty stuff.
