# textDraw
Create a drawing using the natural ocurring spaces on a text by picking phrases out of a book.


Using an ASCII drawing as a model and a book to take phrases from, this program selects phrases of the apropriate lenght and writes them in a new file, in order to reproduce the drawing of the model with the spaces generated in the text.
Pretty stuff.

I cannot upload the book input for legal reasons, the drawing input is model.txt and the output is drawing.txt.

I have uploaded some extra images for a better visualization of the result.
